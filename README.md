# learning_analytics_task

We would like you to complete a data analytics task before the interview. The task brief and the data you need are available at https://github.com/edinkasia/learning_analytics_task

Once youâ€™ve accessed the page, you will be able to download files from there (a pdf `LA_task_brief.pdf` with the task brief and a csv file `student_dataset.csv` with the data). Alternatively, you can fork the GitHub repo. If you have any issues with access, please contact Kasia.Banas@ed.ac.uk.

We will ask you to present your solution to the task at the very start of the interview. You will be able to share your screen via zoom.
